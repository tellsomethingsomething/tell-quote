        question: "Is this actually built for production companies?",
        answer: "Yes. Not adapted from generic project management software. Not a CRM with some tweaks. Built from scratch by people who've run production companies. We know what a day rate is. We know what a call sheet needs. We know you quote in sections and need to track margins."
    },
    {
        question: "What types of production companies use this?",
        answer: "Video production, event production, photography studios, live streaming companies, post-production houses, corporate video teams. Anyone who quotes projects, books crew, tracks equipment, and wants to know if they're actually making money."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I import my existing data?",
        answer: "Yes. Import clients, crew, and equipment from CSV or Excel. We provide templates. Most users migrate their data in under an hour. You don't have to start from scratch."
    },
    {
        question: "Does it replace my accounting software?",
        answer: "No, and it's not trying to. ProductionOS handles quoting, invoicing, and project-level financials. Keep using Xero, QuickBooks, or your accountant for tax and formal bookkeeping. We handle the production-specific stuff they can't."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does setup take?",
        answer: "Most users are up and running in under an hour. Creating your first quote takes about 10 minutes. No training required. If you've used any modern software, you'll figure it out."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens when my trial ends?",
        answer: "Your account becomes read-only. You can still see all your data, but you can't create new quotes or projects. We keep your data for 30 days. No surprise charges ever."
    },
    {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer: "Yes. We use Supabase (PostgreSQL) with row-level security. All data encrypted in transit and at rest. Your data is isolated from other customers. We're hosted on enterprise-grade infrastructure with 99.9% uptime."
